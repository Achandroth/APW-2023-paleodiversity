> Indeed, there are many things that we might never know about extinct species, such as their true geographic range or abundances. But, for now, we should view our knowledge of the history of life on Earth as a work in progress - *Roger Benson* (2018)

## Purpose

This repository contains all materials, such as code and slideshows, for *Day 4: Exploring fossil occurrence data and fossil record biases* of the Analytical Paleobiology Workshop. There are three main parts to this class and each one has an associated exercise in R:

1. **Databases in Paleobiology** - available databases, futurproofing, accessing the Paleobiology Database and importing datasets into R
2. **Fossil record biases** - exaploring the impact of biases on estimates of diversity through visualisations and simple statistics
3. **Sampling standardisation** - Rarefaction/Extrapolation curves, coverage-based rarefaction with iNEXT, Shareholder Quorum Subsampling (SQS), and squares

## Using this repo

For the duration of the workshop, this will be a public repository. After the workshop it will be returned to private while we work on updating it for next time. 

To use it, you can fork the repo, which creates a copy of it for you to use without making changes to this original one. Or you can simply download it as a .zip file to your computer and with with it from there.
